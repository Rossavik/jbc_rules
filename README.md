## 📜 JBC Soldering Station Commandments

1. **Thou shall not remove soldering tin before powering off.**  
   - Always leave the tip tinned when shutting down.  
   - Exposing a clean tip surface causes oxidation → reduced heat transfer and shorter tip life.

2. **Thou shall not use the JBC for non-electronic soldering.**  
   - Only use it for melting tin solder to/between copper surfaces.  
   - Do not use it on plastics, steel, or other experimental materials.  
   - For unusual jobs, use alternative soldering stations.

3. **Thou shall not exceed 400 °C.**  
   - Higher temps damage both the tip and the PCB.  
   - Normal working range: **330–370 °C**.  
   - If solder won’t melt at 400 °C, check you are not using the wrong material (e.g., steel wire) or replace the tip.

4. **Thou shall use flux.**  
   - Flux is your friend! It removes oxides and improves solder bonding.  
   - Apply flux **before** the soldering iron.  
   - Use moderately to avoid sticky residue.  
   - If solder isn’t melting properly, apply flux (see Commandment 3).

5. **Thou shall not use excessive force.**  
   - Solder should flow easily—don’t press hard.  
   - Scraping or pressing damages the tip plating, leading to failure.  
   - The same applies when cleaning with brass wool or the wiper.

## 🔄 Changing Tips
- Tips can be swapped cold by hand.  
- Hot swapping is possible, but follow the correct procedure.  
- The station does **not heat** until the iron is picked up from the stand.  
- It heats from sleep to working temp in ~2 seconds.

## 🧽 Cleaning Tips
- When the tip is extra dirty:  
  1. Use the wiper first.  
  2. Then clean with brass wool.  
- **Do not use excessive force** when cleaning.
